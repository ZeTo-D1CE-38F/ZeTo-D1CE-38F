[#1] A lonely empty wolf, wandering in the darkness of the night, explores the starry sky, in search of abandoned thoughts, desires, and choices - in search of forgotten stars.

[#2] Thought is a desire, and with desire - comes choice.

[#3] The flower of loneliness blooms at night.

[#4] Loneliness is a choice, the flowering of desire in the constellation of the wolf's soul.

[#5] The constellation of the soul is just a mirror for the wolf.

[#6] Nightly darkness, gusts of wind, and the wolf looks at the constellation - looks at the loneliness that has become his choice, his star.

[#7] The darkness of the night covers abandoned thoughts, the wind scatters them, and the wolf in solitude explores the constellation of his soul in search of answers to his choice and light illuminating his path for thoughts and desires.

[#8] The wolf collects the discarded bones of his soul.
