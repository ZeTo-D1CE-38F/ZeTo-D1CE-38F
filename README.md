[#1] A lonely empty wolf, wandering in the darkness of the night, explores the starry sky, in search of abandoned thoughts, desires, and choices - in search of forgotten stars.

[#2] Thought is a desire, and with desire - comes choice.

[#3] The flower of loneliness blooms at night.

[#4] Loneliness is a choice, the flowering of desire in the constellation of the wolf's soul.

[#5] The constellation of the soul is just a mirror for the wolf.

[#6] Nightly darkness, gusts of wind, and the wolf looks at the constellation - looks at the loneliness that has become his choice, his star.

[#7] The darkness of the night covers abandoned thoughts, the wind dispels them and the wolf explores his soul constellation in search of answers to the sources of desires.

[#8] The wolf collects the discarded bones of his soul.
